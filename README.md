spatial-knn-implementations
===========================

Explore the implementations of spatial k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithms. 

I write some code to implement the KNN algorithm to search the k nearest 
neighbors (including edges and nodes) for my own research. So far, I just
implemented a simple version based on the grid partition and indexing.
